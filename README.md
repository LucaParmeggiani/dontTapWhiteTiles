# Rules
<p> Rules are pretty simple, you actually just have to click the black tiles avoiding the white ones.
<p> You can either click with your mouse left button or with <kbd>Z</kbd> and <kbd>X</kbd> on your keyboard.
<p> There are six difficulties, scaling up with difficulty the tiles becomes smaller and the game bagins to be harder because you have to aim correctly too otherwise you just lose.
